== Description ==
The Coupon Reveal Button plugin is the easiest way to quickly create and manage your call to action (CTA) buttons, whether you're an expert or a beginner. Simply enter your button text, text reveal and link - and our easy coupon maker will create a reveal button for you to easily insert on your pages with a shortcode.

Customize your coupon reveal with your own color scheme and easily manage, use and re-use all your coupon- and/or bonus code reveal buttons on any page with this wordpress coupon plugin.


Most affiliate websites use coupon codes and discount codes to generate revenue in a simple and modern way. 
Users often end up getting the discount code, without clicking an affiliate link. We have solved that through this coupon code reveal button, once the user click the button they are redirected to the affiliate link, while being shown the discount code. 

Use our button generator to create coupon reveal buttons and display them through shortcodes with the new Gutenberg shortcode block. You can also add it to widgets or any other text editor you prefer.

After a user click the button an animation happens and a more minimal button is shown with the coupon code revealed on it.
The buttons generated are lightweight, seo optimized, fast and responsive.  

The button that is shown on your site is built with minimal code using Javascript, HTML and CSS.
